# A modified ElvUI Classic

Forked from https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic

## Changes

* Healing prediction bars show if other people will heal before you for up to 2 heals. Should be enough to decide whether to cancel or not most of the time.
* Tags support HealComm events, added tags that show predicted HP after incoming heals (see Available Tags -> Health in ElvUI settings).
* Added healing prediction for target of target frame.
* Custom healthbar color for charmed units, can be toggled for each unitframe type in the respective Health category.
